<h1>Sales-Analysis-Project</h1>
<h2></h2>Developed a dynamic sales analysis dashboard utilizing Power BI, enabling the visualization of sales trends, top-selling products, and revenue measures. The dashboard provided actionable insights for informed decision-making and strategic business growth.<h2/>

<h1>INSIGHTS</h1>

In order to come up with this visualization, I used Power Query Editor in Power Bi to initially transform unorganized data before creating this visualization. Then, using the order date column, I generated the calculative column for the month name, month number, day name, and day number.

Created a "Month Name" column from the date column in order to view monthly analysis.

Created a "Day Name" column from the date column to identify the days of the week products were purchased.


In this visualization, I could identify:

Sales Trend: The line graph indicates that December had highest sales figures. This can be as a result of the December holiday and practice of exchanging gifts.

Top selling products: We can identify which are the top 5 selling products by using a bar chart.

We may determine revenue and the revenue measure by calculating the sales quantity and profit margin using KPIs. This indicates that this year's profit was high.

Also did some additional analysis to find out top 5 cities by sales using the map visual and top 5 products by sales using the tree map.
